# Hi there, I'm Matt - aka [creekmore.io](https://creekmore.io) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2019 graduate of University of North Carolina Wilmington and a software developer!

## Heres what you can find here:

## [Moves](https://creekmore.io/#/moves): 2020

A fully-deployed Flutter app for tracking your local inventories.
Once previously available for download on both Apple and Play stores. Dart was a joy to work with on this.

This project taught me a lot about

- mobile-oriented design
- real-world app store deployment
- utilizing mobile GPS, permissions
- sqlite
- google maps api integration
- firestore integration
- stateful and stateless components
- Android and iOS app configuration and build processes

Deprecated once I started full-time after graduating college.

## [creekmore.io](https://creekmore.io/#/): 2019

A full-stack Vue2, Express, Mongo project.

The API here also operated as the backend service for the [Moves](https://creekmore.io/#/moves) app

Key concepts I take away from this project are:

- designing re-usable ui components in Vue
- async
- mongoDB, database models
- state management with VueX
- localStorage, cookies, JWTs
- principles of RESTful APIs
- user authentication API, password hashing
- private/public page routing
