# Hi there, I'm Matt - aka [creekmore.io](https://creekmore.io) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 2019 graduate of University of North Carolina Wilmington and a software developer!

## Here's what you can find here:

## [Moves](https://creekmore.io/#/moves)

A fully-deployed Flutter app for crowd-sourced tracking your local inventories.

Once previously available for download on both Apple and Play stores. Dart was a joy to work with on this.

This project taught me a lot about:

- mobile-oriented design
- real-world app store deployment
- utilizing mobile GPS, permissions, hardware APIs
- sqlite
- google maps api integration
- firestore integration
- stateful and stateless components
- Android and iOS app configuration and build processes

Deprecated once I started full-time after graduating college.

## [creekmore.io](https://creekmore.io/#/)

A full-stack Vue2, Express, Mongo project.

The API here also operated as the backend service for the [Moves](https://creekmore.io/#/moves) app

Key concepts I take away from this project are:

- designing reusable ui components in Vue
- async
- mongoDB, database models
- state management with VueX
- localStorage, cookies, JWTs
- principles of RESTful APIs
- user authentication API, password hashing
- private/public page routing

## [pms](https://github.com/mcreekmore/pms)

An Ansible project for automatically provisioning my devices.

This repo is in a way the culmination of me messing around with hardware and linux ever since middle school. It allows me to iterate on my personal media server much quicker.

Over the years, I've added the following competencies to my belt through this hobby:

- linux
- linux server administration
- networking
- docker
- docker-compose
- virtualization
- automation, scripting, services
- the will to control the continuous urge to spend more money on it
- just kidding on that last one... i can't control it.
